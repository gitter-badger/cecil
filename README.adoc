== 🤖 Cecil - an AWS EC2 instance garbage collector

Cecil is a monitoring tool designed to aggresively cleanup EC2 instance garbage and avoid unwanted AWS charges from idle or forgotten instances.  

It's geared towards doing **development and testing** in AWS, and takes a heavily automated and self-serve approach:

. Whenever you start a new EC2 instance, Cecil assigns a short-term lease to you (3 days by default) for that instance and notifies you via email.
. When the lease is about to expire, Cecil will notify you by email and give you a chance to renew the lease if you're still actually using it.
. Unless you renew the lease, Cecil will automatically terminate the EC2 instance.

Cecil was developed at http://www.couchbase.com[Couchbase] image:docs/images/couchbase.png[link=http://www.couchbase.com] to help control AWS costs related to large-scale performance testing of it's https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/architecture/architecture-intro.html[distributed NoSQL database].


== Features

* ✅ Configurable lease expiration times, number of renewals allowed, maximum number of leases per user
* ✅ Assign leases based on SSH keypair or EC2 tag
* ✅ Explicitly group instances into a single lease via a custom tag
* ✅ Monitor multiple AWS accounts from a single Cecil instance via STS role assumption
* ✅ Low latency Stream based approach via Cloudwatch Events
* ✅ Treats Cloudformations and AutoScalingGroups as individual units


== Roadmap

* 💡 Offhours support -- stop and restart EBS-backed instances based on a schedule
* 💡 Slackbot / Hipchat bot support (https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/blob/master/docs/index.asciidoc#slack-integration[work in progress])
* 💡 Usage Reports (https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/issues/122[work in progress])

== Quick Start 

=== Deploy Clouformation 

Deploy the following cloudformation template with an SQS Queue and an IAM Role to the **us-east-1** region. 

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=CecilRootStack&templateURL=http://cecil-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/cecil-root.template]

Create an AWS access key for the newly created CecilRootUser IAM user.  

```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name CecilRootUser
```

This will return something like:

```
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIEXAMPLERQ4U4N67LE7A"
        "SecretAccessKey": "je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY",
        ... 
    }
}
```

=== Launch on Docker Cloud

image:https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg[link=https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/?repo=https://github.com/tleyden/cecil] 

You will need to customize the environment variables in the Stack according to the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` returned above, and your AWS account ID.

=== Launch on OSX 

Alternatively, download the https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/releases/download/v0.5.6/cecil_0.5.6_darwin_amd64.tar.gz[OSX release binary] and unzip it.

Set the following environment variables that correspond to the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` returned above, and replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual AWS account id, which is numeric and might look something like `78861235`:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIEXAMPLERQ4U4N67LE7A \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***** \
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID 
```

Launch the process:

```
$ cecil
```

Congrats!  Cecil is now running.
