== ü§ñ Cecil - an AWS EC2 instance garbage collector

Cecil is a monitoring tool designed to aggresively cleanup EC2 instance garbage and avoid unwanted AWS charges from idle or forgotten instances.  

It's geared towards doing **development and testing** in AWS, and takes a heavily automated and self-serve approach:

. Whenever you start a new EC2 instance, Cecil assigns a short-term lease to you (3 days by default) for that instance and notifies you via email.
. When the lease is about to expire, Cecil will notify you by email and give you a chance to renew the lease if you're still actually using it.
. Unless you renew the lease, Cecil will automatically terminate the EC2 instance.

Cecil was developed at http://www.couchbase.com[Couchbase] image:http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/couchbase.png[link=http://www.couchbase.com] to help control AWS costs related to large-scale performance testing of it's https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/architecture/architecture-intro.html[distributed NoSQL database].


== Features

* ‚úÖ Configurable lease expiration times with multiple lease expiry warnings
* ‚úÖ Auto-assign leases based on SSH keypair or `CecilOwner` EC2 tag
* ‚úÖ Ability to group instances into a single lease via `CecilInstanceGroup` EC2 tag
* ‚úÖ Groups Cloudformations and AutoScalingGroups instances into a single lease by default
* ‚úÖ Monitor multiple AWS accounts from a single Cecil instance via STS role assumption
* ‚úÖ Low latency stream based approach via Cloudwatch Events


== Roadmap

* üí° Scheduled Reports: identify long running instances (https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/issues/122[work in progress]) 
* üí° Offhours support: stop and restart EBS-backed instances during nights and weekends
* üí° Slack bot support (https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/blob/master/docs/index.asciidoc#slack-integration[work in progress])
* üí° https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/issues/new[Add a feature request!]

== Quick Start 

=== Deploy Clouformation 

Deploy the following cloudformation template to the **us-east-1** region. 

image:https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=CecilRootStack&templateURL=http://cecil-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/cecil-root.template]

Create an AWS access key for the newly created CecilRootUser IAM user.  

```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name CecilRootUser
```

This will return something like:

```
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIEXAMPLERQ4U4N67LE7A"
        "SecretAccessKey": "je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY",
        ... 
    }
}
```

At this point a new SQS Queue and an IAM Role will be added to your AWS account, which will be used by the Cecil process that will be launched in the next step.

=== Launch Cecil on Docker Cloud

image:https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg[link=https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/?repo=https://github.com/tleyden/cecil] 

You will need to customize the environment variables in the Stack according to the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` returned above, and your AWS account ID.

NOTE: this won't work until the repo is made public

=== Launch Cecil on OSX 

Alternatively, download the https://github.com/tleyden/cecil/releases/download/v0.5.6/cecil_0.5.6_darwin_amd64.tar.gz[OSX release binary] and unzip it.

Set the following environment variables that correspond to the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` returned above, and replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual AWS account id, which is numeric and might look something like `78861235`:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIEXAMPLERQ4U4N67LE7A \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***** \
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID 
```

Launch the process:

```
$ cecil
```

Congrats!  Cecil is now running.
