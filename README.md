# ðŸ¤– Cecil - an AWS EC2 instance garbage collector

Cecil is a monitoring and clean-up tool designed to make it as hard as possible to let EC2 instance garbage accumulate and rack up pointless AWS charges.  It's geared towards doing **development and testing** in AWS.

It uses automation and a self-serve approach to minimizing EC2 waste:

1. Whenever you start a new EC2 instance, Cecil assigns a lease to you for that instance and notifies you via email.
1. When the lease is about to expire, Cecil will notify you by email and give you a chance to renew it if you're still actually using it.
1. Unless you renew the lease, Cecil will automatically terminate the EC2 instance.

Cecil was developed at [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com) [![Couchbase](docs/images/couchbase.png)](http://www.couchbase.com) to help control AWS costs related to performance testing of it's [open source distributed NoSQL database](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/architecture/architecture-intro.html).


# Features

* âœ… Monitor multiple AWS accounts from a single Cecil instance via STS role assumption
* âœ… Stream based approach via Cloudwatch Events
* âœ… Treats Cloudformations and AutoScalingGroups as individual units
* âœ… Explicitly group instances into a single lease via a custom tag
* âœ… Assign leases based on SSH key or an owner tag
* âœ… Configurable lease expiration times, number of renewals allowed, maximum number of leases per user
