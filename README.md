# ðŸ¤– Cecil - an AWS EC2 instance garbage collector

Cecil is a monitoring tool designed to make it as hard as possible to let EC2 instance garbage accumulate and rack up pointless AWS charges. ðŸ’° It's geared towards doing **development and testing** in AWS.

It uses automation and a self-serve approach to minimizing EC2 waste:

1. Whenever you start a new EC2 instance, Cecil assigns a lease to you for that instance and notifies you via email.
1. When the lease is about to expire, Cecil will notify you by email and give you a chance to renew it if you're still actually using it.
1. Unless you renew the lease, Cecil will automatically shut it down.

Cecil was developed at [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com) [![Couchbase](docs/images/couchbase.png)](http://www.couchbase.com) to help control AWS costs related to performance testing of it's [open source distributed NoSQL database](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/architecture/architecture-intro.html).


# How it works

ðŸ›  **One-time setup**

1. Install the single-binary Cecil server process somewhere -- in your data center, in AWS, in docker cloud, or even on your workstation just to try it out.
1. Configure Cecil to monitor Cloudwatch Event streams of one or more AWS accounts
1. Create an Account Administrator email address which will be assigned all leases that can't otherwise be assigned to the person who launched it
1. Configure Cecil to tell it how to associate newly launched EC2 instances with owners -- you can setup mappings between AWS Key Pairs and Email addresses, or you can have people add a `CecilOwner` tag that contains their email address when they launch instances.  

ðŸš€ **Each time an EC2 instance is launched**

1. When a new instance is detected on the CloudWatch Event stream, a lease will be created and assigned to the person who launched it, or the admin user if the owner can't be identified.
1. When the lease is about to expire (3 days later by default), the owner is notified by email twice: 24 hours before and 1 hour before by default, and given a chance to extend the lease by clicking a link.
1. If the lease isn't extended and eventually expires, then the instance associated with the lease will get terminated.

# Features

* âœ… Monitor multiple AWS accounts from a single Cecil instance via STS role assumption
* âœ… Stream based approach via Cloudwatch Events
* âœ… Treats Cloudformations and AutoScalingGroups as individual units
* âœ… Explicitly group instances into a single lease via a custom tag
* âœ… Assign leases based on SSH key or an owner tag
* âœ… Configurable lease expiration times, number of renewals allowed, maximum number of leases per user
